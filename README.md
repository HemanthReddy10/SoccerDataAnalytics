The purpose of this project is to analyze the FIFA 19 data set using a variety of Machine Learning techniques. The data set contains skill attributes, as well as information about 18000 players. With our project, we predict players' overall ratings and their position on the field. To determine the best hypothesis, we tested two hypotheses in the project development. Important Phases of Project:

Data Cleaning
Feature engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis 4.Data Modeling
Data Prediction
VisualisationTools
